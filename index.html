        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <h3>An Indian revolutionary</h3>
        <blockquote id="Bio" cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kartar_Singh_Sarabha">

        <p><b>Kartar Singh Sarabha</b>(24 May 1896 â€” 16 November 1915) was an Indian revolutionary. He was 15-years old when he became a member of Ghadar Party; he then became a leading luminary member and started fighting for the independence movement &amp; He was one of the most active members of the movement. In November 1915 at <em>Central Jail, Lahore,</em> he was executed for his role in the movement when he was 19 years old. <br> <br> Singh was born to Mangal Singh Grewal and Sahib Kaur into a Ravidassia Sikh family in Sarabha, a village near Ludhiana in Punjab. He was very young when his father died and his grandfather brought him up. After receiving his initial education in his village, Singh entered the <strong> Malwa Khalsa high school</strong> in Ludhiana &amp;he studied there until 8th standard &amp; He sailed to San Francisco in July 1912 to enroll at the University of California at Berkeley, but the evidence that he did study there varies. A historical note by Baba Jwala Singh mentions that when he went to <i> Astoria</i> Oregon in December 1912, he found Kartar Singh working in a mill factory. The University does not have any record of Kartar Singh&apos;s enrollment.</p>
